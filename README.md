# Gold-Price-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of gold. The price of gold is influenced by various factors such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Predicting its price accurately can be challenging due to the complex interplay of these factors.

In this project, historical data of gold prices along with relevant features are used to train machine learning models. Various regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are implemented and compared to determine the most effective model for gold price prediction.

The repository includes:

Data Preparation: Scripts for collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing historical gold price data along with additional features such as economic indicators and market sentiment data.

Model Training: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for gold price prediction using libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Evaluation: Evaluation metrics and visualization techniques to assess the performance of the trained models.

Prediction: Scripts to make predictions on future gold prices based on the trained models.

Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the project setup, data sources, model selection, and usage instructions.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the future trends of gold prices, aiding investors, financial analysts, and policymakers in making informed decisions. Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the prediction models.
